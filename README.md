# [CS:228 - Probabilistic Graphical Models](https://cs.stanford.edu/~ermon/cs228/index.html)

PGM ! PGM ! PGM ! One of the most interesting class yet challenging at Stanford is CS228. Graphical Models ahoi!, There's also an online preview of the course, [here](http://scpd.stanford.edu/search/publicCourseSearchDetails.do?method=load&courseId=11761) or [here](https://mvideos.stanford.edu/Previews) , only  the overview lecture though. The course heavily follows Daphne Koller's book [Probabilistic Graphical Models: Principles and Techniques by Daphne Koller and Nir Friedman.](https://github.com/SKKSaikia/CS228_PGM/blob/master/Probabilistic%20Graphical%20Models%20-%20Principles%20and%20Techniques.pdf), and There's also an online version of "Probabilistic Graphical Models" on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/probabilistic-graphical-models). I [completed](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/R63SHPRXHBC8) the [online](https://github.com/liang456/Stanford-Probabilistic-Graphical-Models-Coursera) [version](https://github.com/kuo000/stanford-pgm) as a freshman, and here I take CS228 again. I got [enrolled](https://github.com/SKKSaikia/CS228_PGM/blob/master/gradescope.PNG) on Gradescope, though I am not taking the course in person. Maintain the honor code, keep learning. This is exciting!

<p align="justify"> Probabilistic graphical models are a powerful framework for representing complex domains using probability distributions, with numerous applications in machine learning, computer vision, natural language processing and computational biology. Graphical models bring together graph theory and probability theory, and provide a flexible framework for modeling large collections of random variables with complex interactions. This course will provide a comprehensive survey of the topic, introducing the key formalisms and main techniques used to construct them, make predictions, and support decision-making under uncertainty.</p>

The aim of this course is to develop the knowledge and skills necessary to design, implement and apply these models to solve real problems. The course will cover: 
- (1) Bayesian networks, undirected graphical models and their temporal extensions
- (2) exact and approximate inference methods
- (3) estimation of the parameters and the structure of graphical models.
